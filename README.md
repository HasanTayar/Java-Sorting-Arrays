## Java Sorting Arrays

This repository contains Java code for four different sorting algorithms: selection sort, insertion sort, bubble sort, and counting sort. The code is contained in a single file, sorting.java.

## Selection Sort

The selection sort algorithm sorts an array by repeatedly finding the minimum element from the unsorted part of the array and putting it at the beginning. This implementation of selection sort takes input from the user, sorts the array using selection sort, and then prints the sorted array.

## Usage

To use selection sort, run the main method in sorting.java. The program will prompt you to enter 10 integers, which will be stored in an array. The program will then sort the array using selection sort and print the sorted array.

## Insertion Sort

The insertion sort algorithm sorts an array by taking one element at a time and inserting it into its correct position in a sorted subarray. This implementation of insertion sort takes input from the user, sorts the array using insertion sort, and then prints the sorted array.

## Usage

To use insertion sort, run the main method in sorting.java. The program will prompt you to enter 10 integers, which will be stored in an array. The program will then sort the array using insertion sort and print the sorted array.

## Bubble Sort

The bubble sort algorithm sorts an array by repeatedly swapping adjacent elements that are in the wrong order. This implementation of bubble sort takes input from the user, sorts the array using bubble sort, and then prints the sorted array.

## Usage

To use bubble sort, run the main method in sorting.java. The program will prompt you to enter 10 integers, which will be stored in an array. The program will then sort the array using bubble sort and print the sorted array.

## Counting Sort

The counting sort algorithm sorts an array by counting the number of occurrences of each element and using this information to determine the order of the elements. This implementation of counting sort takes input from the user, sorts the array using counting sort, and then prints the sorted array.

## Usage

To use counting sort, run the main method in sorting.java. The program will prompt you to enter 10 integers, which will be stored in an array. The program will then sort the array using counting sort and print the sorted array.
